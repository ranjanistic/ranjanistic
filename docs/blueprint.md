- Background color: Off-white (#F5F5F5), provides a clean and sophisticated backdrop.
- Accent color: Pale cyan (#AFEEEE), used to highlight interactive elements and create visual interest.
- Incorporate dark and light colour transitions, especially with large text elements, to create a visually appealing, magazine-style aesthetic.
- Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif), offering a modern and neutral base for the site.
- Headline font: 'Belleza' (sans-serif), adding personality in small doses to sections and articles. If long bodies of text are used, apply 'Alegreya' (serif).
- Minimalist line icons for navigation and key sections, to maintain a clean and modern look.
- Use a grid-based layout for a structured and balanced design.
- Subtle transition animations between pages and sections to provide a polished user experience, including scroll-based transitions. Animations should be intuitive and useful, without being over-the-top.
